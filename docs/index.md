# Python training platform
A comprehensive Python learning platform prepared for learners at all levels, offering interactive lessons, hands-on coding exercises, and real-world projects to build practical skills. The platform also includes resources to reinforce foundational Python concepts, with a focus on core principles rather than specific libraries or modules. The content is organized into four main sections: Python Basics, Python Projects, Workshops, and Concise Notes.


### [Book](book/overview/) 
This section serves as the foundation of the platform, presenting a series of structured chapters that guide users through the process of learning Python. The chapters include:

- [Chapter 1: Primer](book/ch1_primer/ch1_overview/)
- [Chapter 2: computation](book/ch2_computation/ch2_overview.md/)
- [Chapter 3: Data analysis](book/ch3_data_analysis/ch3_overview/)
- [Chapter 4: Visualization](book/ch4_visualization/ch4_overview/)
- [Chapter 5: Working with files](book/ch5_file/ch5_overview.md/)
- [Chapter 6: OS](book/ch6_os/ch6_overview.md/)
- [Chapter 7: Decorator](book/ch7_decorator/ch7_overview.md/)
- [Chapter 8: Class](book/ch8_class/ch8_overview.md/)
- [Chapter 9: Higher-order functions](book/ch9_high_funcs/ch9_overview.md/)
- [Chapter 10: Multiprocessing](book/ch10_multiprocessing/ch10_overview.md/)
- [Chapter 11: Regex](book/ch11_regex/ch11_overview.md/)
- [Chapter 12: Testing and debugging](book/ch12_debugging/ch12_overview.md/)
- [Chapter 13: Package](book/ch13_package/ch13_overview.md/)

### [Python projects](python_projects/overview.md/)
This section features projects that can be used to learn about Python's applications.

### [Workshop](workshop/) 
This workshop offers practical insights and support for those embarking on their data analysis journey with Python.

### [Concise notes](concise_notes/)
