    "### list Comprehension\n",
    "List comprehension in Python is a concise method for generating a list from an existing sequence. The general syntax for list comprehension is as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the components: <br>\n",
    "`new_list`: This is the new list that will be created.  <br>\n",
    "`expression`: It represents an expression that defines how each item in the iterable will be transformed and added to the new list. <br>\n",
    "`item`: It is a variable that takes on each element of the iterable one at a time. <br>\n",
    "`iterable`: This is the sequence or iterable from which the elements will be taken. <br>\n",
    "`condition` (optional): It specifies an optional filter that determines whether an element from the iterable is included in the new list.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions are a powerful and readable way to create lists in Python, and they are often used when you want to apply a transformation or filter to elements from an existing iterable. Below is a list generated using a `for` loop; rewrite it using a list comprehension."
