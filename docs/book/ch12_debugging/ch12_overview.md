title: Overview
---

This section covers fundamental topics related to testing, logging, and debugging. These topics are essential because the standard does not include a compiler to catch bugs automatically. Therefore, the only way to ensure your code works correctly is to run it and thoroughly test all of its features.

* [Error handling](ch12_error_handling.md) This section explain how to handle error handling, detecting, and responding to errors that occur during the execution of a program.
* [Logging](ch12_logging.md) This section discusses the logging module, which provides a flexible framework for generating log messages. It allows you to track events that occur during your program's execution, which is essential for debugging, monitoring, and maintaining your code.
* [Debugging](ch12_debugging.md) Here, we explain the process of identifying, analyzing, and fixing bugs in Python code.
* [Challenges](ch12_challenges.md)
